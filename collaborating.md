# Collaborating

Here are a few idea on how we can collaborate

## Levels
One or more expert developers are project leads - they define the future of the project
Expert developers are called Committers - they can commit to master
new entries are called Contributors - they contribute, and a committer must review and commmit

## Bug/Feature Tracking

We use a bug tracking system where we keep all the resources

* Say there is an entry level bug that is incentivized. I am external, interested in it. I will definitely ask questions to whoever created the bug
