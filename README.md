## What is Open Source

We don't have a formal definition on how an Open Source Project should qualify as such.

Anyway, as mentioned by swhitenstall , the community tend to agree on the unambiguous Open Source Definition as presented here: https://opensource.org/osd

A pragmatic help in the direction of creating an Open Source project would be considering the below concise operational definition (drawn from a concise procedural definition provided by GitBook, and compatible with the opensource definition, although a bit stricter)


A project does not qualify as Open Source if:

* Doesn't exist on GitHub or GitLab or another VCS
* Is not public or doesn't allow public contributions in some other way
* Is empty with no significant content or activity
* Is just a fork with no activity of its own
* Doesn't have a README.md file that explains what the software is about
* Doesn't have a CONTRIBUTING.md file that explains how to contribute
* Doesn't have a LICENSE file with a valid OSS license
* Doesn't have a basic CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file
* Isn't friendly to public contributions


Summarizing

a good practical checklist is provided above
